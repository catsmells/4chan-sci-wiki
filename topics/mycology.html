<h3><u>How to Identify A Mushroom</u></h3>

<p>Identifying mushrooms is a unique mix between skill and knowledge. It takes experience to be able to identify an edible and rule out all the look-alikes. Ideally, you will be able to preserve a specimen and dry it, take a sporeprint and look at its spores under a microscope, but this is not always an option. Many mycologists do not use any of these methods, because they are not needed. There are some species you will not be able to identify without a microscope, but most species you will be able to identify based on morphology alone. <br />
Here are some good practices for when you are identifying a mushroom, in no particular order:</p>

<p>1. Bring a pocket knife - you will need to use a pocket knife to cut the bases of some species.<br />
2. Use a basket - baskets let the spores of mushrooms spread freely.<br />
3. Take lots of notes - some species are easily identified by certain attributes that you will not be able to note after bringing them inside.<br />
4. Note where the mushroom is coming from - the ecology of a mushroom is very important in identification. Some species only come out of dead or rotting trees, some are terrestrial, some are parasitic, and some grow symbiotically with plants.<br />
5. Collect mushrooms at all different stages of development, if you can - mushrooms change vastly throughout their development. Knowing what the mushroom looks like as a "button" could change everything.<br />
6. Ask a friend - other people are your greatest resource in mycology. If you can ask someone who knows more about mycology than you do, you should.<br />
7. Use your resources - if you can get your hands on a field guide for mushrooms in your region, do that. If not, get one for your country.<br />

<p>To preserve a mushroom, dry it out in a food dehydrator and place it along with notes on it and the species name, if identified, in a ziploc bag.</p>

<h3><u>How to Create a Spore Print</u></h3>

<p>Knowing the color of the spores of a mushroom is very important for identification. Here is a guide for creating a spore print:</p>

<p>Step 0: Examine the mushroom<br />
If the mushroom is young, or has a "partial veil", then you will not be able to get a spore print. You might find natural spore prints on older specimens. If you see a dust under the mushroom, especially in layered mushrooms and conks, then that is a natural spore print.<br />
Step 1: Cut off the stem<br />
Step 1.5: For large specimens, or if you only have one specimen, you may want to cut out a section of the cap instead of using the whole thing.<br />
Step 2: Place the cap on a piece of paper, pores or gills down.<br />
Step 3: Optionally, put a drop of water on the cap to initiate spore production.<br />
Step 4: Place a cup or some sort of covering over the cap.<br />
Step 5: Wait overnight<br />
Step 6: Record the color in a notebook and/or take a picture.<br />
Step 7: Optionally, spray the spores with hairspray to preserve.<br />

<p>This does not come close to conveying a fraction of the information there is to know about mycology. Mycology is a very broad subject with many different sub-fields. Here I have outlined only the very basics of identifying mushrooms. This page may be updated in the future with a cultivation guide. For extensive knowledge, read the resources.</p>
